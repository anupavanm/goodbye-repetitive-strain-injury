## :facepunch: Say goodbye to RSI ##

As Software Developers, we spend much our time glued to a computer developing the software to run this world. Often we neglect ourselves and some of us suffer in constant chronic pain (hand/back/wrist/hips etc.) ultimately leading to reduced productivity. some of us may fear it might permanently ruin hapiness and probably livelihood as well :fearful:.

We blame everything  on PC mouse/keyboard and frequent use of a computer :computer: as a primary cause. We do all the necessary corrections to relieve ourselves from pain
 * Buying a new ergonomic mouse, keyboard, adjustable table
 * Take frequent breaks (including stretching my wrist and fingers). 
 * Even take plenty of supplements (magnesium, B-complex, Bromelain).
 * Stop playing video games after work
 * Sit in chair with ice on hands and watch TV for hours :clock830:
 
**Despite doing all these changes to ur lifestyle, the pain just lowers a bit. Never gets cured permanently :exclamation:**
And then your pain gets back within a short span of using the computer.
```
\\\Finally we realize our brain has a global constants in memory
const Typing = "PAIN"
const LeftClick = "PAIN"
const RightClick = "PAIN"

```
