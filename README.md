## :facepunch: Say goodbye to RSI ##

*I wrestled with wrist pain for about a year. I was blaming my PC mouse and frequent use of a computer as a primary cause. I have done all the necessary corrections, bought a new ergonomic mouse, adjusted table and monitor height, took frequent breaks (including stretching my wrist and fingers). I also took plenty of supplements (magnesium, B-complex, Bromelain). The pain just lowered a bit but sustained.*

*dealing with crippling hand pain for weeks. It would build throughout the day and by the time the sun went down, I could do nothing except sit in my chair with ice on my hands and watch TV. As someone who makes his living programming computers and enjoys recreationally lifting weights, cooking, and other activities associated with "repetitive strain injury," naturally I was deeply concerned that I had somehow permanently injured my hands. Was this going to permanently ruin my happiness and probably my livelihood as well?*

*I suffered from nagging back and neck pain, debilitating chronic headaches and a frustrating case of TMJ - all sorts of aches and pains - from my teen years to late 20s, despite being young and healthy. Like many, I tried all conventional treatment to no avail and thought my body was broken.*
